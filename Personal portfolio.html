    <p>From childhood I have always been interested in computers and enjoyed developing my skills. 
    After completing a degree in management, which honed my skills in navigating my way around a pc, 
    I worked as a reporter, then a carpenter and a short time as a caretaker. These were all valuable experiences, 
    and the carpentry gave me an eye for detail and accuracy. I am hardworking and enthusiastic and hope to 
    bring my skills to the computer programming industry.</p>
